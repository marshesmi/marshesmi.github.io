            <div class="description">Things I've started or finished that don't get their own page...yet <br>
                I started the braid-in rag rug in Maine while I was helping my friend Daniel clean out his family's island cottage. <br> He gave me a bunch of old sheets that I cut into strips, folded into squares, and photographed in a meadow. Now I am very slowly braiding them into a rug. <br>
                The Big Blue Basket is made from blue sheets. I started in California with my brother Cody's old bed sheets.  When I ran out I found more while visiting my friend Arianna in Idaho. <br>
    
                I've also been collecting knitted squares, but I haven't thought about what I'm going to do with them.
