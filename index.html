    <br>My name is Mariah Smith. 
    <br>
    <br>My background is in Architecture, and my work with rag rugs began with my research into the relationship between
    <br>domestic handicraft and the built environment. I work under the assumption that textiles are an element of
    <br>architecture and homemaking is design. Domestic crafts like mending and rag rug weaving are inherently
    sustainable,
    <br>and I am interested in the care that goes into ensuring the longevity of handcrafted objects. My work is rooted
    in
    <br>repeatedly re-working/re-interpreting the surfaces and patterns that surround our most intimate selves ;)
    <br>
    <br>I have a Masterâ€™s in Architecture from Princeton University (M.Arch received in 2020) and a Bachelor of
    Arts in
    <br>Architecture from UC Berkeley (B.A. received in 2015)
