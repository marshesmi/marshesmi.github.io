            <div class="description"> This is a house designed for a rural housing studio taught by Florencia Pita and
                Jackilin Bloom at Princeton University in the Spring of 2019.
                <br>The house is sited in the rural landscape
                to the north of Mexico City, Mexico.
                <br> Its walls act like the pivot doors common throughout Mexico City, opening the house onto the
                landscape while also making room for future generations.
                <br> When all the walls are closed, the house is suitable for a set of parents, and a couple of kids.
                Beyond the immediate boundary of the house are free-standing walls that can pivot away from and toward
                the house to transform the exterior spaces into inhabitable, shaded nooks.
                <br> When the parents become grandparents, the walls can open to make room for the growing family. What
                was originally a bedroom and a separate bathroom opens up to create a small apartment. The second
                washroom opens onto the landscape and doubles as a work area. All of the rooms have two access points,
                allowing for fluid movement throughout the living and work spaces.
                <br>
                <br> The model is made in three parts of dyed and cast rockite, basswood, acetate, and dollhouse hinges.
